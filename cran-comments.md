Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This release simply updates the author field in CITATION file to be as.person compatible, as requested by CRAN.  I have also fixed the pandoc error on winbuilder now.  

Some additional metadata has also been added to the DESCRIPTION file using the term "keywords."  The term produces the NOTE "possibly misspelled field," since it is not recognized, but my understanding from reading the Policies is that this is still acceptable.  (Discussed further in https://github.com/codemeta/codemetar/issues/22).  

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
