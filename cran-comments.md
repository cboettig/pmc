Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This avoids the warning of a the DOI being incorrectly recognized as a URL by the markdown parser in the vignette.

Also, Uwe asks: "Will you actively maintain this now"?

Yes, I will, as I indicated by checking to abide by CRAN policies, and as I always have to the best of my abilities. My apologies that it was archived because of ground-up changes in a  dependency which required ground-up rewrite of this package. I have spoken to the maintainers of that package and understand the current version is more stable (as it has proved in the past 2 years).  Understand that these were exceptional circumstances and not mere negligance on my part as a maintainer. At the time the package was archived I did not have the capacity to address these changes, so archiving was the only option.  Now in response to substantial user requests I've been able to rewrite this package from scratch and build the relationship necessary to carefully coordinate with the maintainers of the geiger package to make sure this does not happen again.  Thank you so much for understanding.

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
