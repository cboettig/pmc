Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This submission updates the previously archived `pmc` package to make it compatible with the current CRAN version of the `geiger` package, whose major updates several years ago broke `pmc` and led to it being archived. Though most of the methods have been re-written from scratch, this preserves the function API of the main functions of the package.

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
