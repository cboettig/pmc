[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cboettig/pmc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cboettig/pmc) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cboettig/pmc/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/cboettig/pmc)

**Beta, use with caution!**

This is a lightweight implementation of my `pmc` package focusing on what I think are the more common use cases (e.g. it will no longer support comparisons of a `geiger` model against an `ouch` model). Further, it does not cover many of the newer model fitting that have been implemented since `pmc` was first released. 

The goal of this release is mostly to provide compatibility with current versions of `geiger`.

## Getting started


Install the package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github("cboettig/pmc2")
```

A trivial example with data simulated from the `lambda` model. 

```{r}
library("pmc")
library("geiger")
phy <- sim.bdtree(n=10)
dat <- sim.char(rescale(phy, "lambda", .5), 1)[,1,]
out <- pmc(phy, dat, "BM", "lambda", nboot = 50)

```

Plot the results:

```{r}
dists <- data.frame(null = out$null, test = out$test)
library("ggplot2")
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
dists %>% 
  gather(dist, value) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, fill = dist)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = out$lr)

```
